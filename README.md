Welcome to the Van Manager application!

We are excited that you are taking part in responsible fleet management, and will be servicing your vehicles regularly.

This application works for all sorts of vehicles not just vans, all you need is at least one vehicle!

When you open Van Manager for the first time, you will need to create an account. To do so please select 'Create Account' with the arrow keys and press enter, your cursor location is represented by the :minibus: symbol.

Then, type your company name and press enter/return.

Then, type your desired username and press enter/return. ***This is important to remember because this will be used for all future log-ins.***

After creating an account it is time to build your fleet!

You will want to select 'Add_Van_to_Fleet' and press enter/return.

***It is important to note that ALL fields are required when adding a van to your fleet.***
First, you will be prompted for what you would like the van's name to be, please type what you would like the van to be called in the system and press enter/return.

Second, type the 'year' of the vehicle and press enter/return.

Third, type the 'make' of the vehicle and press enter/return.

Fourth, type the 'model' of the vehicle and press enter/return.

Lastly, type the current 'mileage' of the vehicle and press enter/return.
**Another important thing to note, this app works best if all vehicles have the same maintenance schedule, i.e. same service intervals.**

Now you are given the options to repeat this process and add another vehicle to your fleet, view your fleet, or to complete setup and exit the application. This process can be repeated for however many vehicles you have in your fleet.

'Add_Van_to_Fleet' will repeat the above steps

'View_Fleet' will show your fleet in entirety. When you 'View Fleet' you will see your 'Company Name' and a list of your vehicles aka your fleet.

While viewing your fleet you can then 'Update_Vehicle_Mileage'.

If a vehicle is at a mileage where a service is required it will appear as the last line for that vehicle and be RED in font.

Now you can exit the application, log back in, update mileage of vehicles in your fleet and if service is needed on a vehicle take that bad boy in for service to keep your fleet running for as long as possible.

Thanks for using Van Manager!
